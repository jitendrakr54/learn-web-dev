********************************************* Understanding the course project setup ***********************************
. Added index.html and favicon for title

********************************************* Adding CSS to our project with Inline Styles *****************************
. <section style="background: #ff1b68">
. not recommended

**************************************** Understanding the <style> tag & creating a .css file *************************
. A selector simply is an additional piece of information that tells CSS to which element in your DOM, so inside of your 
  body and the body is also treated as an element by the way, to which element you want to assign this declaration.

. Refer pdf

. Using external css is recommended. using an extra stylesheet, you can have a clear separation of your HTML and your 
  CSS code which is especially useful as your CSS code grows and it would bloat your head section at some point and 
  additionally if you use the same stylesheet in multiple pages let's say, then your browser can cache the stylesheet 
  and doesn't need to re-download it for every new page, whereas if you include your styles in the head section, you 
  increase the file size of your HTML file and the browser needs to re-download it since it's part of the HTML page for 
  every new page which can be slower.

**************************************** Applying additional styles & importing google fonts *************************
. To change the font we need to change the "font-family". you can use a default font family, like sans-serif. This is a 
  special keyword which will use the default set up in your browser. Now where is this coming from?

  Now for this, we should open our browser preferences. In these preferences and that of course depends on your browser 
  but in Chrome, you've got the customize fonts area and each browser should have something like this.

  Now you're not limited to using font families included on your system, however sans-serif, serif and monospace are 
  always great values because they will use the browser defaults.

  Sometimes you want a specific font though and you can't rely on that font being installed on the machine of the user,
  so to include a font which is not necessarily install ready, you can use a tool called Google Fonts.

. Refer index.html

********************************************** Theory Time - Selectors **************************************************
. cabab case is recommended for writing class name and ids for html

. CSS stands for cascading style sheets and cascading simply means multiple styles can be applied or multiple rules can 
  be applied to the same element. Now these rules may lead to conflicts though, here for example, we got our color set 
  up in the h1 tag and in the section title class.

  Now to resolve such conflicts, CSS knows a concept called specificity and there are clear rules included in the CSS 
  specification that define how such conflict should be resolved and which type of selector has a higher specificity.

. Refer pdf notes for specifity order

********************************************** Understanding Inheritance  ********************************************
. Inheritance is an important concept for passing styles down without explicitly selecting an element and especially for 
  things like font sizes, font families, this is extremely useful because you typically want to have one and the same 
  style for the majority of your text on your screen and therefore, setting this up in the body section is a great way 
  as it will then make sure you can use inheritance.

. therefore, some styles, not all there are exceptions but we'll dive into this later, some styles, especially the 
  font-related styles are passed down to child. However inheritance has a very low specificity, inheritance always comes 
  at the bottom even below the browser defaults.

**************************************************** Adding Combinators ********************************************
. A combinator allows us to combine multiple selectors to be more precise about what we want to select. As a side note 
  if you use combinators, you also create a higher specificity.
