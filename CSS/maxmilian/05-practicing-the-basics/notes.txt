. So when we click on a button, we get this blue outline, another browser default. You can inspect it in the developer
  tools by selecting the button and then clicking on this pseudo selector hov thing here. and when we check focus we see
  blue outline here. Now the outline is comparable to a border but it's not part of the box model, keep in mind the border
  is part of the box model, the outline actually is not. The outline is just some additional border-like thing which 
  actually is applied outside of the box,

  so before the margin but after the border and it's therefore like a lighter version of the border. You can style it with
  the outline property.

. When we set float: right to free package it goes to he right but the premium package takes it's space, so basically it
  floats around free package. What we have to do is we have to basically keep its space reserved and tell the other block 
  level elements that come after it that they shouldn't respect any previous floatings.

  and we do this with a little hack and that's why you don't really use floats for positioning anymore, it's ugly, you add
  an additional helper div after the element you've floated, so after the free plan section here, a div which you simply
  give a class with any name of your choice, I'll name it clear fix because I will fix the floating with something which 
  is called clear and then you define that class, I'll define it before I add my hashtags, my ID selectors clear fix and 
  there you have one property clear both, which means clear floats on both sides, left and right which are the two values
  you can assign here.

  This means any elements coming after this element or an element with that class will not respect previous floats.
