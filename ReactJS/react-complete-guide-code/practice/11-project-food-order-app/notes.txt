. Importing CSS files or importing images is supported by this project setup which we're using here and behind the scenes
  the import is simply transformed to include the image in the finished application which we could deploy to a server
  and to generate a link to that image which is then dynamically inserted in the generators code.

  import mealsImage from "../../assets/meals.jpg";
  <img src={mealsImage} /> If image is available locally
  <img src="https://some-url.com/to-some-image.jpg" /> If image is on server
