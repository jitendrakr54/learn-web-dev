. Other react libraries/framework to explore:
. Gatsby: Gatsby is another library for React, so which builds up on React, which acts as a static site generator using 
  React. And you can learn more about Gatsby on their official page of course, but in the end Gatsby allows you to 
  leverage your React knowledge to then produce static websites which only consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but 
  which are pre-rendered in advance so that search engines see what your users will see before JavaScript code is 
  executed in the browser and therefore Gatsby can help you offer a better user experience, it can help you with search 
  engine optimization, and it can act as a nice alternative to Next.js

. Now Preact, in the end, is React with a way smaller footprint. It has the same API, so the same functionalities React 
  offers, for example, it has all those React hooks, but it's way smaller. Now this of course sounds like magic and it 
  sounds like you should always use Preact, but of course, it achieves this very small size by stripping out internal 
  functionality React has built-in, functionality that might offer a smoother user experience once your app is up and 
  running. but that is something you'll have to find out on your own. Diving into Preact and playing around with it,
  might definitely worth a thought because you might not be building an application that needs all those built-in 
  optimizations React has to offer, and in that case, Preact might be a great alternative

. Now React Native is a framework for React also built by Facebook, so by the same company that's responsible for React,
  that actually allows you to build mobile apps for iOS and Android with React. And that's of course super amazing,
  because that means that you can use the knowledge you already have and you cannot just build websites and web apps 
  with it, but you can also build mobile apps with it. And you don't need to learn Android or iOS development or 
  programming languages for those devices, you can really just use what you already know, JavaScript and React.
